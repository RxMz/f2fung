		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<p>
		This guide is designed for most Waterloo students 
		whose only US income comes from J1-visa internships.
		Lucky you! You get to fill out 3 sets of taxes this year! As a Canadian in the US,
		you'll first file your <b>State</b> and <b>Federal</b> taxes. Afterwards, you'll
		report the amount of tax you've paid in the US on your <b>Canadian</b> tax return so
		you aren't double-taxed.
		</p>

		<h3>Federal</h3>

		You are probably going to get a refund. This is because you got taxed at a high tax
		bracket which assumed you were going to be paid all year-around. You weren't, so you're
		getting back the difference.

		<p>In summary, you are a <b>non-resident</b> who qualifies for <b>no additional tax exemptions</b> because:
			<ul>
				<li>You do not count as a student in the United States.</li>
				<li>If you paid for relocation, you can't count it until you've stayed for 39 consecutive weeks.</li>
				<li>Have no dependents.</li>
				<li>Have been filing US taxes for fewer than 3 years. (<i>Not the case? <a href="http://feli.xxx/taxreferences">Read [5] here</a>.</i>)
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>The best thing to do is to file the <b>1040NR-EZ</b>. At the time of writing, there is <b>no way for you to electronically file your Federal Taxes</b>.</p>

		<p>Forms:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040nre.pdf">1040NR-EZ</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8843.pdf">8843</a></li>

		<h3>State</h3>

		<p>You will have to file a state tax return for each state you've worked in.</p> 

		<h3>California</h3>

		<p>If California is the only state you've worked in, you only need to file the <b>540NR Short Form</b>. Otherwise,
		you'll require both the <b>540NR Long Form</b> as well as the <b>Schedule of California Adjustments</b> (unaddressed by this guide).
		At the time of writing, there is <b>no way for you to electronically file your California taxes</b>.</p>

		<p><b>If you receive a refund</b>, you will also receive a receipt for your refund in a <b>Form 1099-G</b>. You enter this as a <b>taxable refund</b> on your next year's federal return (1040NR-EZ, Line 4).</p>

		<h3>Connecticut</h3>

		<p>If you are looking to receive your tax refund by cheque, you'll notice you can't fit an international address there. I e-mailed the Department of Revenue Services who advised me to, "Please enter the additional information in the space provided. We will make every effort to fit your address in our system."</p>
